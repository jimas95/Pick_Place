2 packages are in this repository.
1. diff_drive: The challenge is to create a differential-drive robot that can be simulated in Gazebo and controlled by ROS.
    1. The robot will be able to flip over and continue driving.
    2. The robot will move through a world filled with Jersey Barriers and trash.
    3. The robot will be able to follow a set of points completing a rectangle trajectory.
2. arm_move: In this project we will use the MoveIt Python API to create a planning scene and perform some path planning tasks.
    1. The robot arm sits on top of a table. There is a Box also that sits on top of the table and is an obstacle.
    2. The robot has to pick an object for one side of the obstacle and place on the other while avoiding the box obstacle.
